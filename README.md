#start with a number of lives

# when play is pushed, start the game

# choose a random word from the words file and show the places of the total number of letters

# let words all be uppercase

# let the player choose a letter for the word and make it uppercase

# make sure it is just a letter - return a wrong message if a non-letter was typed

# if letter is right fill out letter in the right place

# show the word and leave the places with not guessed letters blank

# if letter is wrong give a message it is wrong

# if the letter is wrong decrease the numbers of live and display an extra limb on the hangman

# end the game after the number of lives is 0 / hangman full OR if no letters are left to guess

# print a message with the results
